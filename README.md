# language_Partner_Python_ChatGpt
## I built a prototype to have conversation in Spanish (Spain not Latin America). The user speaks in English and ChatGpt responds in Spanish. 

I am using this tool to improve my Spanish conversation skill because I want to have a good conversation with my significant other's family in Spain. At the same time I want to learn new technology and how to use it.
